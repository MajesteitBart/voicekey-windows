# VoiceKey User Installation Guide (Windows)

This guide is for end users who just want VoiceKey running on Windows.

## Current install status

At this moment, VoiceKey is **not distributed as a one-click installer** (`.msi`/setup wizard) and **not as a single-file executable**.

The current distributable format is:

- a **portable folder** generated by PyInstaller `--onedir`
- entry point: `VoiceKey.exe`
- required runtime files must stay next to the executable

In practice: users can run VoiceKey from one executable file, but they must keep the **whole folder** intact.

## What users need

- Windows 10 or 11
- Microphone access enabled in Windows privacy settings
- A Mistral API key with Voxtral access

## Install option A (recommended for end users): portable bundle

If a maintainer provides a prebuilt `dist/VoiceKey` folder:

1. Download and extract the folder to a stable location, for example:
   - `C:\Apps\VoiceKey\`
2. Ensure the folder still contains `VoiceKey.exe` and accompanying runtime files.
3. Double-click `VoiceKey.exe`.
4. Right-click the tray icon and open **Settings**.
5. Set your API key in **Settings** and click **Save**.

### API key storage

- VoiceKey reads the API key from `%APPDATA%\VoiceKey\config.json` (`api_key`).
- The recommended way to set it is the in-app **Settings** window.

## Install option B (developer/advanced): run from source

1. Install Python 3.11+.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run VoiceKey:

```bash
python voicekey.py
```

## Install option C (developer): build your own portable EXE

From repository root on Windows:

```bat
build.bat
```

Build output:

- `dist\VoiceKey\VoiceKey.exe`
- additional files under `dist\VoiceKey\` (required)

## First run checklist for users

- Verify tray icon appears.
- Hold and release the hotkey (default: Right Alt) in a text field.
- If no text appears:
  - run as Administrator (for elevated target apps)
  - check microphone permissions
  - verify API key and credits

## Known limitation: no single-file installer yet

To provide true one-click installation for non-technical users, the project still needs:

- a packaged installer flow (`.msi`, MSIX, or Inno Setup)
- optional code signing for better Windows trust prompts
- release automation to attach signed binaries to GitHub Releases

Until then, distribute the portable `dist\VoiceKey` folder or ask users to run from source.
